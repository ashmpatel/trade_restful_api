# Trade Upload And Processing Using Spring and CSV files

This project is for tutorial purposes.<br />

<h2>Description & Feature</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Implements a simple Trade File Upload processing and lookup in a product map</li>
  <li>Single file upload.</li>
  <li>Two test files are included in this project - products.csv and trade.csv, both in the ../main/resources folder</li>
</ul>


<h3>Steps</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Build the project</h4>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Build the project using : mvn clean install 
      </br>
       Uses Jdk 17.0.2
    </li>
  </li>  
      <br>
        java -version
 <br>
        java version "17.0.2" 2022-01-18 LTS
 <br>
        Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.2+8-LTS-86)
 <br>
        Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.2+8-LTS-86, mixed mode, sharing)
 <br>
 <br>
        mvn -version
 <br>
        Apache Maven 3.8.1 (05c21c65bdfed0f71a2f2ada8b84da59348c4c5d)
 <br>
        Java version: 17.0.2, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: c:\jdk-17.0.2

<h3>How to upload a file to test this code</h3>
    <li>Run the main class for this project <code>mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.springboot.Application""</code></li>
    <li>Open Postman to access the api of this project</li>
    <li>Set url at<br /><code>http://localhost:8080/api/vi/enrich </code> and use POST method</li>
    <li>From body tab select <code>form-data</code> Screen shots are in the resources folder of this project.</li>
    <li>Select type <code>File</code> for a key and name the key as <code>file</code></li>
    <li>In value section choose a file from your PC by browsing to upload. In this example, select trades.csv. See screenshot in resources folder of the code</li>
    <li>Alternatively you can use <code>curl</code> like this.
        Start the projects main class : <code>com.example.springboot.Application</code>
        Go to the the command prompt.
        Make sure the file trades.csv is in that folder OR copy it from the resources folder to THIS folder
        you are in right now.
        Then run: <code>curl --location http://localhost:8080/api/vi/enrich --form file=@"trade.csv" </code>
  </ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Things that can be improved</h3>
 <li>Use Streams to process the data that comes in the file upload</li>
 <li>Spark has streaming methods that can be used to stream process the file data</li>
 <li>We can upload the whole file onto disk storage and then use the memory mapped code included
to process this trade file and lookup in the products data as we read line by line.
Look at the class ProcessTradeData included that shows how this can be done.</li>
<li>
The trade data can be split into chunks and each can be uploaded and processed
in parallel then the results joined. Completeable Futures and threads can be 
used to do this. <code>Akka framework </code>makes it easy to use message passing to coordinate this processing.
</li>
<h3>Note</h3>
<li>There are a few tests included that tests the core functionality of looking up the trade product ids
and the memory mapped file processing code. I need to add tests for the RESTful api side.
Stright forward matter of using WebClient etc.
</li>

<li>
When building the code with <code>mvn clean install</code>
Then run <code>mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.springboot.Application"</code>
</li>
